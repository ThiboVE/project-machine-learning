  abstract  = {Examined are relations between the energies of the transport gaps (i.e., the gaps determined by UPS/IPES measurements and taken for 'true' HOMO-LUMO gaps), and the electrochemical gaps (determined from CV experiments) and optical gaps (determined from UV-VIS optical spectroscopy). The statistics, based on literature data for several small (non-polymeric) molecules, shows that, on average, the electrochemical measurements underestimate the gap energies by ca. 16%, and the optical gap is smaller than the transport gap by ca. 37%. These differences seriously affect the accuracy of determination of energies of HOMO and LUMO levels by indirect methods. The concordance with the results obtained from the UPS/IPES measurements can be improved by using correction factors put forward in the present paper.},

abstract = {UV-Vis can be used as an easy and forthright technique to accurately estimate the band gap energy of organic π-conjugated materials, widely used as thin films/composites in organic and hybrid electronic devices such as OLEDs, OPVs and OFETs. The electronic and optical properties, including HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of π-conjugated systems were evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy in CHCl3 solution for a large number of relevant π-conjugated systems: tris-8-hydroxyquinolinatos (Alq3, Gaq3, Inq3, Al(qNO2)3, Al(qCl)3, Al(qBr)3, In(qNO2)3, In(qCl)3 and In(qBr)3); triphenylamine derivatives (DDP, p-TTP, TPB, TPD, TDAB, m-MTDAB, NPB, α-NPD); oligoacenes (naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and rubrene); oligothiophenes (α-2T, β-2T, α-3T, β-3T, α-4T and α-5T). Additionally, some electronic properties were also explored by quantum chemical calculations. The experimental UV-Vis data are in accordance with the DFT predictions and indicate that the band gap energies of the OSCs dissolved in CHCl3 solution are consistent with the values presented for thin films.}
