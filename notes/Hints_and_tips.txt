✅ Normalize the targets (HOMO-LUMO gap values) before training (mean/std normalization).
✅ Split data carefully — use a random or scaffold split to avoid data leakage.
✅ Scale descriptors if using linear models.
✅ Evaluate with RMSE or MAE (mean absolute error).
✅ Watch for correlation between HOMO, LUMO, and gap — they’re related but not identical.
✅ Visualize distributions — helps understand outliers and chemical space coverage.
