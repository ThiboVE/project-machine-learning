Option1: Graph based systems
        -> Use the built in graph features (x, edge-index) from QM9
        -> GCN, GIN, MPNN
        -> Don't need the SMILES representation for this
Option2: Descriptoe-based models (simpler to start with)
        -> Extract SMILES strings from the QM9 data systems
        -> Use RDKit to compute molecular descriptors or fingerprints
        -> These can be fed into a simple ML model (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
        -> Leads to good baseline results with easier models
